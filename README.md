This is the intro assignment for COT4500. It is also my first time
ever coding in python so some of the methods utilized may not be the 
most efficient or optimal. 

The sole requirement for the code to function is the use of numpy, which is on version 1.24.1 as stated in the requirements txt file.

To execute the code, simply type:

python "path/intro_to_python.py"

into the command prompt


The result should return:

[[1 0 0]
 [0 1 0]
 [0 0 1]]

[[1 3 3]
 [3 1 3]
 [3 3 1]]

[[1 3]
 [3 1]
 [3 3]]
